# React Native AsyncStorage getItem Returns Undefined or Null

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications when using AsyncStorage.  The problem occurs when attempting to access a value stored in AsyncStorage before the asynchronous getItem operation has completed.  This results in undefined or null values being returned, even though the data exists within AsyncStorage.

## Problem

The issue is that AsyncStorage.getItem is asynchronous; it doesn't immediately return the value. If you try to use the value directly after calling getItem, it may still be undefined or null because the asynchronous operation hasn't finished yet.  This is a common pitfall that can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.

## Solution

The solution lies in properly handling the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage.getItem. We must ensure that any code that relies on the retrieved value is placed inside the `.then` block or by using async/await.
