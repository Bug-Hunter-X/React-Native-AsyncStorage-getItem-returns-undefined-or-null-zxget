This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and trying to access the value before it has been fully retrieved.  It manifests as undefined or null values despite the AsyncStorage seeming to have the data.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then(value => {
  console.log(value); // value might be undefined or null here
  // Use value immediately; this could cause problems if value isn't ready
});
```
